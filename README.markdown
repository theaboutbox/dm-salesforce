dm-salesforce
=============

A gem that provides a Salesforce Adapter for DataMapper.

The wsdl is automatically converted into Ruby classes upon the first
invocation of the dm-salesforce adapter.  The classes in turn get
cached locally in one of the following locations, in order of
precedence:

    :repositories:salesforce:apidir (see included database.yml-example)
    ENV["SALESFORCE_DIR"]
    ~/.salesforce/

It just works if you have the wsdl, directions for getting going are
outlined below.

An example of using the adapter:

    class Account
      include DataMapper::Resource

      def self.default_repository_name
        :salesforce
      end

      def self.salesforce_id_properties
        :id
      end

      property :id, String, :serial => true
      property :name, String
    end

    class Contact
      include DataMapper::Resource

      def self.default_repository_name
        :salesforce
      end

      def self.salesforce_id_properties
        [:id, :account_id]
      end

      property :id,    String, :serial => true
      property :first_name, String
      property :last_name, String
      property :email, String
      property :account_id, String

      belongs_to :account
    end


To get a test environment going with the free development tools you'll need to follow these steps.


* Get a developer account from http://force.salesforce.com
* Hit up https://login.salesforce.com, and login with the password they provided in your signup email
* Remember the password they force you to reset
* Grab the following from Salesforce's web UI
    *  Your Enterprise API WSDL [Click Setup][setup] and [Expand and Save As][getwsdl]
    *  Your API Token [Reset if needed][gettoken]
* Copy the WSDL file you downloaded to config/wsdl.xml
*   Copy and modify config/database.rb-example to use your info.  In this case my password is 'skateboards' and my API key is 'f938915c9cdc36ff5498881b':

        DataMapper.setup(:salesforce, {:adapter  => 'salesforce',
                                       :username => 'salesforceuser@mydomain.com',
                                       :password => 'skateboardsf938915c9cdc36ff5498881b',
                                       :path     => File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__)+'/wsdl.xml'),
                                       :host     => ''})

        VALID_USER = DataMapperSalesforce::UserDetails.new('salesforceuser@mydomain.com', 'skateboardsf938915c9cdc36ff5498881b')
        VALID_SELF_SERVICE_USER = DataMapperSalesforce::UserDetails.new("quentin@example.com", "foo")
* Run 'bin/irb' and you should have access to the Account and Contact models
